### What I learned

This project prompted me to learn what variable fonts are, their basic understanting, and their numerous applications. This is something i didn't know of, and i'm glad i found out about it.

### Continued development

Working with SVGs to create and style icons is something i never realised until i almost completed the project, in fact, until I completed my third project. I am used to working with font awesome icons for example, and then styling my icons as i see fit, so it was a bit difficult for me to style the svg icons that were provided. Nonetheless, i intend to learn more about SVGs and their application.
